When [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) meets with
integration/acceptance tests to make you see everything in
green. **Libkermit** is a Go(lang) library that aims to ease the
writing of integration tests (any non unit tests actually) with the
helps of Docker and it's ecosystem (mainly
[libcompose](https://github.com/docker/libcompose)).

The goals are :

- Easy docker manipulation, from managing a simple container to boot
  up a whole stack.
    - create, delete, pause, … containers
    - check for a certain state containers (inspect them)
    - support *compose files* to allow starting a whole stack
- Testing suite and functions, in a simple fashion.
- Works seamlessly with the Go(lang) `testing` framework.
- Try to not force any testing framework but also tries to integrate
  with them ([go-check](https://github.com/go-check/check),
  [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify), …).

**Note: This is experimental and not even implemented yet. You are on your own right now**


## Package `docker`

This package holds functions and structs to ease docker uses.

```go
package yours

import (
    "testing"

    "github.com/libkermit/docker"
)

func TestItMyFriend(t *testing.T) {
    project, err := docker.NewProjectFromEnv()
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }
    container, err := project.Start("vdemeester/myawesomeimage")
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Do your stuff
    // […]

    // Clean the containers managed by libkermit
    err = project.Clean()
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

### Package `docker/testing`

This package map the `docker` package but takes a `*testing.T` struct
on all methods. The idea is to write even less. Let's write the same
example as above.


```go
package yours

import (
    "testing"

    docker "github.com/libkermit/docker/testing"
)

func TestItMyFriend(t *testing.T) {
    project := docker.NewProjectFromEnv(t)
    container := project.Start(t, "vdemeester/myawesomeimage")

    // Do your stuff
    // […]

    // Clean the containers managed by libkermit
    project.Clean(t)
}
```

## Other packages to come

- `suite` : functions and structs to setup tests suites.
